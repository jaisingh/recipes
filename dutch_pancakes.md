1 tablespoon oil
2 1/4 cups milk

Directions
----------
# Mix dry ingredients together. Add oil and eggs to this mixture. Slowly add the milk to a very thin consistency. Whisk well til very few lumps remain.
# Fry about 1/2 cup of this mixture at a time in a quite hot frying pan sprayed with pam, you only need to grease the pan intermittantly after that. Spread thinly in the hot pan by tipping the pan in circular motion. The thinner the pancake the better:) Fry them til the top of the pancake appears dry then flip over until it is quite brown on the bottom.
