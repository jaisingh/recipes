5. pressure cook again for 1 whistle on medium to high flame. once the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid.
6. add the sambar powder and tamarind pulp. if the consistency of sambar is thick, then add some water.
7. keep the cooker on the stove and and then simmer the sambar for 10-12 minutes on a low flame.
